This folder contains the 'detached_house.gbxml' gbXML file which gives a description of a detached house.

This house is based on the detached house in the publication from Allen and Pinney.

The file includes:
 - geometry
 - constructions
 - internal heat gains (people, lights and appliances)
 - infiltration
 - schedules
 - electric room heaters
 
The file was created by developing the model of the house in the IES software, exporting the IES model as a gbXML file and then modifying the file to add in extra elements such as the schedules and electric room heaters. 
 
Open the file to view the exact details of the house.
