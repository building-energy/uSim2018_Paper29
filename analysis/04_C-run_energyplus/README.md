# uSim2018_Paper29/analysis/04_C-run_energyplus

This folder contains the '04_C-run_energyplus.ipynb' file which runs an EnergyPlus simulation for each of the 72 modified gbXML files.

For each simulation, the following results are saved:
- the complete outputs from EnergyPlus
- a openbuilding.BimGraph object as a .pickle file
- a .graphml file (for use in Gephi for visualising the graph)
