# uSim2018_Paper29/analysis/openbuilding

This folder contains a prototype Python package called 'openbuilding'. The package is incomplete, not fully documented and at an early stage of development. It is provided here as a local folder so that the code used in the analysis for this paper can import the package and make use of the data structures and methods.

The package creates its own internal data structure based on the graph data structure, and uses this to store and manipulate gbXML and EnergyPlus files. A new graph-based data structure is created that can hold building information and time-series data in the same data structure.

Since the uSim paper was written, it is not clear if this package will be developed further or if a new approach will be taken instead.
